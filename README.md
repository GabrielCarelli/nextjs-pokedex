# NextJS Pokedex

## About the project

This project was developed using Next.js as part of a study on API consumption and data integration with the front-end. For this purpose, I utilized the PokeAPI to build a Pokédex-style web application, allowing users to browse and explore data about Pokémon. It serves as a practical example of how to fetch, process, and display API data within a modern web framework.
